\subsection{Pointer to a function: a common bug}

A notorious bug:

\lstinputlisting[style=customc]{advanced/450_more_ptrs/62.c}

Since function name itself is a pointer to function, or address, 
the \verb|if(function_name)| statement is like \verb|if(true)|.

Unfortunately, a C/C++ compiler wouldn't issue a warning.
